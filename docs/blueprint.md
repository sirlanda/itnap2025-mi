## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Enable secure login using username, password, and email verification. Limit failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks. Incorporate password recovery.
- Test Case Management: Enable creation, modification, and categorization of test cases. Include unique IDs, titles, descriptions, prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, expected results, priority, and status.
- Test Plan Creation: Enable creation and editing of test plans. Each plan should include a unique ID, name, description, list of test cases, and planned execution dates. Assign test cases to testers.

- AI Test Case Suggestion: Tool that suggests potential test cases based on the functional requirements listed in a text input, or from content accessible at a provided URL. Uses LLM reasoning to evaluate what the most critical cases would be to test, given constraints such as time. 
- Report Generation: Create reports in XML and Excel formats with test execution summaries, detailed results, and progress tracking. Include options for filtering and visualization. Schedule periodic reports.
- Notifications: Send email notifications for test case assignments, test plan changes, upcoming deadlines, and completed executions. Allow users to configure notification preferences.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a moderate, authoritative blue (#5C8DAB), suggestive of the systematic and meticulous nature of testing, yet friendly and inviting.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E8F0F4), providing a clean and calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Analogous blue-green (#6BAE8F) to highlight key interactive elements and provide a visual call to action without distracting from the primary content.
- Clean, sans-serif font for clarity and readability.
- Consistent and clear icons for actions and status indicators.
- Well-spaced sections for easy content scanning.
